# Creating of a basic calculator using Python 

# following two lines are the users input
num1 = input("enter a number: ")
num2 = input("enter another number: ")

# creates variable called "result" which is the sum of num1 & num2 which is also being changed into a flaot data type, which changed from string to numbers with decimal points
result = float(num1) + float(num2)

print(result)
